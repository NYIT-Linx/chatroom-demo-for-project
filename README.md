# chatroom-demo-for-project
this is a code i found online for the chatroom, we can use this as a reference when we actually get around to designing out own chatroom.
 The XML files that ARE NOT in the layout folder, are to be plaed in the drawable folder. The .java files are to be made into a java class and then you copy and paste the code over.
